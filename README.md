# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

## Overview

# This project is part of the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera, part of the Data Science Specialization by Johns Hopkins University. The objective is to demonstrate your # ability to collect, clean, and create a tidy data set from raw data.

# The data analyzed comes from the [UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones), 
# which contains recordings of 30 volunteers performing various activities while wearing a smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

## Contents of the Repository

This GitHub repository contains the following files:

* `run_analysis.R`: Main R script that performs all the data cleaning and transformation steps as required by the course project instructions.
* `FinalData.txt`: The tidy dataset output generated by the script. It contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* `README.md`: This file, explaining the purpose of the repository and how to use the files.
* `CodeBook.md`: A codebook describing the dataset, variables, and the transformations performed.

## How to Run the Script

To reproduce this analysis:

1. Download the original data set from:
   [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

2. Unzip the contents and place the folder **`UCI HAR Dataset`** in your R working directory.

3. Place the `run_analysis.R` script in the same directory as the unzipped dataset.

4. Open R or RStudio and run:

source("run_analysis.R")

##The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps:

Reads the training and test datasets (subject IDs, activity labels, and feature data).

Merges the training and test datasets into one complete dataset.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Uses descriptive activity names (e.g., WALKING, SITTING) to replace activity codes in the dataset.

Labels the dataset with descriptive variable names by cleaning up the feature labels.

Creates a second tidy dataset, FinalData.txt, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
