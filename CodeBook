CodeBook
Overview
This codebook describes the variables in the tidy dataset FinalData.txt created from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The data consists of the average of each measurement variable for each subject and each activity.

Identifiers
| Variable   | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `subject`  | Integer identifier for the subject (1 to 30) |
| `activity` | Activity label performed by the subject      |


Activity labels include:
- WALKING
- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
- SITTING
- STANDING
- LAYING

Feature Variables
The remaining variables are numeric values representing the average of the measurements related to mean and standard deviation for each subject-activity pair. All have been cleaned and renamed for clarity.
